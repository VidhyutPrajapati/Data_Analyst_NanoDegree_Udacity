# Investigate_Medicare_Appointent_Data

## Project Overview

- The primary goal of the project is to go through the dataset and the general data analysis process using numpy, pandas and matplotlib. This data set contains information more than 10,000 patients collected from medicare information providers, including user their diseases and appointment information.
- In this project, you will analyze a dataset and then communicate your findings about it. You will use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib to make your analysis easier.

## What do you need to install?

You will need an installation of Python, plus the following libraries:

- pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- csv

## Why this Project?

In this project, you'll go through the data analysis process and see how everything fits together. Later Nanodegree projects will focus on individual pieces of the data analysis process.

You'll use the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib, which make writing data analysis code in Python a lot easier! Not only that, these are sought-after skills by employers!

## What will you learn?

After completing the project, you will:

- Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
- Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
- Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
- Have practice communicating the results of your analysis
- Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
- Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
- Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

## Exploratory Data Analysis

Tip: Now that you've trimmed and cleaned your data, you're ready to move on to exploration. Compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions that you posed in the Introduction section. It is recommended that you be systematic with your approach. Look at one variable at a time, and then follow it up by looking at relationships between variables.

## Research Questions

## Summary

From the investigated data set "Medical appointment dataset", the following questions were explored:

1. What is the shape of dataset?
2. What is the attributes behavior in the dataset?
3. How much difference are there for “having a Scholarship” and “not having a scholarship”?
4. Age wise distribution of Scholarship.
5. How is all the diseases looks like visually for the given patients? like what age group is suffering for which kind of disease more?
6. Which age-group patients doesn't show up?
7. Which gender have a more no-show ratio?
8. Gender vise distribution with Age distribution for No-show.

## Data Wrangling

1. Drop unnecessary columns
2. Rename columns
3. Delete the line with the missing values
4. Fill empty fields with specific values

There are some potential limitations to the analysis presented in this work and there are some potential areas were the given data could be explored such as:

The correlation between Scholarship candidates and given appointment. Does having a scholarship always get high show up on the appointment day?
